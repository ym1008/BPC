# Bootstrap Predictive Coding (BPC)

Bootstrapped Predictive Coding (BPC) is a causal non-contrastive self-supervised model for speech representation learning, where past context predicts a bootstrapped smaller future context, in a non-contrastive fashion. We compare this with both a comparable contrastive model (similar to wav2vec) and also both contrastive and non-contrastive masked models (similar to wav2vec2.0 and data2vec respectively).
